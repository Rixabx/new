<p >Born and raised in Madeira, Ronaldo began his senior club career playing for Sporting CP, before signing with Manchester United in 2003, aged 18, winning the FA Cup in his first season. He would also go onto win three consecutive Premier League titles, the Champions League, and the FIFA Club World Cup; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-most expensive association football transfer when he signed for Real Madrid in 2009 in a transfer worth €94 million (£80 million), where he won 15 trophies, including two La Liga titles, two Copa del Rey, four Champions Leagues, and became the club's all-time top goalscorer. He also finished runner-up for the Ballon d'Or three times, behind Lionel Messi (his perceived career rival), and won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in 2013 and 2014, and again in 2016 and 2017.</p>
<p>Ronaldo made his senior international debut for Portugal in 2003 at age 18, and has since earned over 170 caps, including appearing and scoring in eleven major tournaments, becoming Portugal's most capped player and his country's all-time top goalscorer. He scored his first international goal at Euro 2004, where he helped Portugal reach the final, and assumed full captaincy of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the Portuguese Football Federation.  </p>
<p>One of the most marketable and famous athletes in the world, Ronaldo was ranked the world's highest-paid athlete by Forbes in 2016 and 2017 and the world's most famous athlete by ESPN from 2016 to 2019. Time included him on their list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn $1 billion in their career. </p>
<p>Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro was born in São Pedro, Funchal, on the Portuguese island of Madeira, and grew up in Santo António, Funchal.[9][10] He is the fourth and youngest child of Maria Dolores dos Santos Viveiros da Aveiro, a cook, and José Dinis Aveiro, a municipal gardener and part-time kit man.[11] His great-grandmother on his father's side, Isabel da Piedade, was from the island of São Vicente, Cape Verde.[12] He has one older brother, Hugo, and two older sisters, Elma and Liliana Cátia "Katia".[13] His mother revealed that she wanted to abort him due to poverty, his father's alcoholism and having too many children already, but her doctor refused to perform the procedure.[14] Ronaldo grew up in a Catholic and impoverished home, sharing a room with all his siblings.</P>
<p>Ronaldo became Manchester United's first Portuguese player when he signed before the 2003–04 season.[30] His transfer fee of £12.24 million made him, at the time, the most expensive teenager in English football history.[31] Although he requested the number 28, his number at Sporting, he received the squad number 7 shirt, which had previously been worn by such United players as George Best, Eric Cantona, and David Beckham.[32] Wearing the number 7 became an extra source of motivation for Ronaldo.[33] A key element in his development during his time in England proved to be his manager Alex Ferguson, of whom he later said: "He's been my father in sport, one of the most important and influential factors in my career."</P>
<p>At the quarter-final stage of the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League, Ronaldo scored his first goals in his 30th match in the competition,[61] finding the net twice in a 7–1 victory over Roma.[62] He subsequently scored four minutes into the first semi-final leg against Milan, which ended in a 3–2 win,[63] but was marked out of the second leg as United lost 3–0 at the San Siro.[64] He also helped United reach the 2007 FA Cup Final, but the decisive match against Chelsea ended in a 1–0 defeat. [</P>
<p>Ahead of the 2008–09 season, on 7 July, Ronaldo underwent ankle surgery,[90] which kept him out of action for 10 weeks.[91] Following his return, he scored his 100th goal in all competitions for United with the first of two free kicks in a 5–0 win against Stoke City on 15 November,[92] which meant he had now scored against all 19 opposition teams in the Premier League at the time.</p>
<p> During the campaign, the 2011–12 season, Ronaldo surpassed his previous goalscoring feats to achieve a new personal best of 60 goals across all competitions.[130] He regained a place on the 2011 FIFA Ballon d'Or podium, as runner-up to Messi, after scoring hat-tricks against Real Zaragoza, Rayo Vallecano, Málaga, Osasuna, and Sevilla, the last of which put Madrid on top of the league by the season's midway point.</p>

<p>Ronaldo has four children. He first became a father to a son, Cristiano Jr., born on 17 June 2010 in the United States.[503] He stated that he has full custody of the child and would not be publicly revealing the identity of the mother per agreement with her.[504][505] In January 2015, Ronaldo announced his five-year relationship with Russian model Irina Shayk had ended</p>
<p>Ronaldo then became father to twins, daughter Eva and son Mateo, born on 8 June 2017 in the United States via surrogacy.[507] He is in a relationship with Spanish model Georgina Rodríguez, a former shop assistant,[508] who gave birth to their daughter Alana Martina, on 12 November 2017</p>
<p>Ronaldo's father, José, died of an alcoholism-related liver condition at age 52 in September 2005 when Ronaldo was 20.[510][511] Ronaldo said that he does not drink alcohol,[512] and he received libel damages over a Daily Mirror article that reported him drinking heavily in a nightclub while recovering from an injury in July 2008.[513] He also does not have any tattoos as he regularly donates blood and bone marrow.[514] His mother Dolores was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2007 but eventually recovered.</p>
<p>Ronaldo has made contributions to various charitable causes throughout his career. Television footage of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami showed an eight-year-old boy survivor named Martunis wearing a Portuguese football shirt who was stranded for 19 days after his family was killed. Following this, Ronaldo visited Aceh, Indonesia, to raise funds for rehabilitation and reconstruction.</p>
<p>Ronaldo was named the world's most charitable sportsperson in 2015 after donating £5 million to the relief effort after the earthquake in Nepal which killed over 8,000 people.[</p>

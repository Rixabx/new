 <br>   
<h3>Who Is Samuel L. Jackson?</h3>  
<p> Samuel L. Jackson graduated from Morehouse College in 1972 and began his acting career on stage. A move to New York City led to a friendship with Spike Lee and some of his first movie gigs before he enjoyed a star-making turn with a commanding performance in Pulp Fiction. Jackson became a ubiquitous presence on the big screen, appearing in big-budget films like Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and its sequels, and the numerous installments of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. In 2011, he was named the highest-grossing actor of all time with more than $7.2 billion in wealth.</p>

<h3>Early Life</h3>
<p> Jackson was born on December 21, 1948, in Washington, D.C., and was raised in Chattanooga, Tennessee, under his grandmother's strict guidance. His mother, Elizabeth, joined them when he was 10. An early film enthusiast, Jackson frequently saw films at the local theater and gained exposure to the complicated messages surrounding the Black presence on screen. Versions of Band of Angels were edited for the Black audience in Chattanooga, omitting a scene in which Sidney Poitier slaps a white woman.</p>
<p>Jackson's early memories remained with him when he entered the historically Black Morehouse College in Atlanta and became increasingly involved in the Black-power movement. In 1969, during his junior year, he protested the absence of Black people on the board of trustees by locking several board members in a building for two days and was promptly expelled from the college. </p>

<p>That same year, Jackson watched a performance by the Negro Ensemble Company and gained a new inspiration â€” acting. After working as a social worker for two years in Los Angeles, Jackson returned to Morehouse to pursue the study of acting and received his degree in 1972.</p>
 <h3> Early Stage Career</h3>
<p> After college, Jackson joined the Black Image Theatre Company with his future wife, LaTanya Richardson, whom he met at Morehouse's sister school, Spelman College. They toured the country and performed skits characterized by a fiery combination of rage and humor to primarily white audiences. </p>

<p>In 1976, having exhausted their enthusiasm for politically charged theater, Jackson moved with Richardson to Harlem, New York City, to pursue an acting career outside such strictly defined perimeters of race. He began to act in Off-Broadway productions, including Richard Wesley's The Mighty Gents, an adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's Mother Courage and Samm-Art Williams's Home. He also got a job substituting for Bill Cosby during The Cosby Show rehearsals.</p>

<h3> Breakout Role in 'Pulp Fiction'</h3>
<p> In 1994, after establishing a reputation as one of Hollywood's hardest-working actors, Jackson got a chance to play the pivotal role of his career in Quentin Tarantino's instant cult classic, Pulp Fiction. Working from any actor's dream script, Jackson played Jules Winnfield, a sermon-spewing killer with eruptive speeches up to five pages long. He moved and terrified audiences with his impassioned performance, becoming the elusive moral center of the psychologically twisted film. He received an Academy Award nomination for the role.</p>

<h3>Marvel's Nick Fury</h3>
<p>At the time he was named the highest-grossing film actor, Jackson was just beginning his run as Nick Fury in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. After appearing during the end credits of 2008's Iron Man, his character returned for the 2010 sequel and in subsequent films to introduce other Marvel superheroes, including Thor (2011); Captain America: The First Avenger (2011) and The Winter Soldier (2014); The Avengers (2012), Age of Ultron (2015), Infinity War (2018) and Endgame (2019); and Captain Marvel (2019). Additionally, Jackson has appeared as Fury in the TV series Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.</p>

<h3>Personal Life</h3>
<p>Jackson and Richardson married in 1980, and they currently reside in California. They have one child together, a daughter named Zoe. When a reporter asked why his wife stayed with him during his wilder years, he replied, "She always says to me that I have now grown into the man that she always knew I could be."</p>

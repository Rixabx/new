<h3 >Sir Chandrasekhara Venkata Raman FRS was an Indian physicist known for his work in the field of light scattering. With his student K. S. Krishnan, he discovered that when light traverses a transparent material, some of the deflected light changes their paths.</h3>

<p > Born to Tamil Brahmin[6] parents, Raman was a precocious child, completing his secondary and higher secondary education from St Aloysius' Anglo-Indian High School at the ages of 11 and 13, respectively. </p>
<p> He topped the bachelor's degree examination of the University of Madras with honours in physics from Presidency College at age 16. His first research paper, on diffraction of light, was published in 1906 while he was still a graduate student. The next year he obtained an M.A. degree</p>
<p>. He was 19 years of age when he joined the Indian Finance Service in Calcutta as Assistant Accountant General. There he became acquainted with the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), the first research institute in India, which allowed him to do independent research and where he made his major contributions in acoustics and optics. </p>
<p>In 1917, he was appointed as the first Palit Professor of Physics by Ashutosh Mukherjee at the Rajabazar Science College under the University of Calcutta. On his first trip to Europe, seeing the Mediterranean Sea motivated him to identify the prevailing explanation for the blue colour of the sea at the time, namely the reflected Rayleigh-scattered light from the sky, as being incorrect.</p>
<p>He founded the Indian Journal of Physics in 1926. He and Krishnan discovered on 28 February 1928 a novel phenomenon of light scattering, which they called "modified scattering," but more famously known as the Raman effect. The day is celebrated by the Government of India as the National Science Day every year.</P>
<p> Raman moved to the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore in 1933 to become its first Indian Director. There he founded the Indian Academy of Sciences the same year. He established the Raman Research Institute in 1948 where he worked to his last days.</P>
<p>In 1954, the Government of India honoured him with the first Bharat Ratna, its highest civilian award.[8][9] He later smashed the medallion in protest against Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's policies on scientific research.</p>
<p>Raman's elder brother Chandrasekhara Subrahmanya Ayyar had joined the Indian Finance Service (now Indian Audit and Accounts Service),[26] the most prestigious government service in India. [The most coveted service, Indian Civil Service (ICS) was at the time recruited in England.[18]] In no condition to study abroad, Raman followed suit and qualified for the Indian Finance Service with first position in the entrance examination in February 1907.[27] He was posted in Calcutta (now Kolkata) as Assistant Accountant General in June 1907.</p>

<p>  It was there that he became highly impressed with the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), the first research institute founded in India in 1876.[25] He immediately befriended Asutosh Dey, who would eventually become his lifelong collaborator, Amrita Lal Sircar, founder and secretary of IACS, and Ashutosh Mukherjee, executive member of the institute and Vice Chancellor of the University of Calcutta. With such a connection, he obtained permission to conduct research in his own time even "at very unusual hours", as Raman later reminisced.</p>
<p>Up to that time the institute had not yet recruited regular researchers,[28] or produced any research paper.[16] Raman's article "Newton's rings in polarised light" published in Nature in 1907 became the first from the institute.[29] The work inspired IACS to publish a journal Bulletin of Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science in 1909 in which Raman was the major contributor.</p>
<p>n 1909, Raman was transferred to Rangoon, British Burma (now Myanmar), to take up the position of currency officer. After only a few months, he had to return to Madras as his father succumbed to fatal illness. The subsequent death of his father and funeral rituals made him remain there for the rest of the year.[30] Soon after he resumed office at Rangoon, he was transferred back to India at Nagpur, Maharashtra, in 1910.[31] Even before he served a year in Nagpur, he was promoted to Accountant General in 1911 and again posted to Calcutta.</p>
<p>From 1915, the University of Calcutta started assigning research scholars under Raman at IACS. Sudhangsu Kumar Banerji (who later become Director General of Observatories of India Meteorological Department), a PhD scholar under Ganesh Prasad, was his first student.[32] From the next year, other universities followed suit including University of Allahabad, Rangoon University, Queen's College Indore, Institute of Science, Nagpur, Krisnath College, and University of Madras. By 1919, Raman had guided more than a dozen students.[33] Following Sircar's death in 1919, Raman received two honorary positions at IACS, Honorary Professor and Honorary Secretary.</p>
<p>He referred to this period as the "golden era" of his life.
    Raman was chosen by the University of Calcutta to become the Palit Professor of Physics, a position established after the benefactor Sir Taraknath Palit, in 1913. The university senate made the appointment on 30 January 1914, as recorded in the meeting minutes:</p>
